This project is done on Google Colab using pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, keras, KNN, MLP libraries.
This project is based on Hand-written Sketch recognition in which we are recognising the class of hand-drawn sketchs .

Structure of code:
1. In the 1st cell, we imported the libraries.
2. In the 2nd cell, we defined the classes and import url.
3. In the 3rd cell, we downloaded the numpy, bitmap files for 10 classes mentioned above.
4. In the 3rd cell only, we merged different class data.
5. From 4th cell to 7th cell, we divided the data into train_test by cross validator.
6. From 8th to 13th cell, we visualize the data. 
7. In the 16th to 18th cell, we defined a function for replacing the words with their respective abbrevations.
8. In the 19th cell, we plotted sample images.
9. In the 20st cell, we normalize the pixel data.
10. In the 21st cell, we are saving tha data for future use.
11. In the 22rd to 23th cell, we reshape the data to 2-D images.
12. In the 24th to 26th cell, we perform the random forest classifier with grid search.
13. In the 27th to 29th cell, we perform the KNN classifier with grid search.
14. In the 30th to 32th cell, we perform the MLP classifier with grid search.
15. In the 31th to 35th cell, we perform the CNN classifier with grid search.
16. In the 36th to 47th cell, we did feature selection and visualize the feature selection.
17. In the 48th to 50rd cell, we made the new dataset with new features.
18. In the 51th to 53th cell, we perform the random forest classifier with grid search.
19. In the 54th to 56th cell, we perform the KNN classifier with grid search.
20. In the 57th to 59th cell, we perform the MLP classifier with grid search.
21. In the 60th to 63rd cell, we perform the CNN classifier with grid search.
22. In the 64th cell, we compared the model performance of random forest before and after feature selection.
23. In the 65th cell, we compared the model performance of KNN before and after feature selection.
24. In the 66th cell, we compared the model performance of MLP before and after feature selection.
25. In the 67th cell, we compared the model performance of CNN before and after feature selection.
